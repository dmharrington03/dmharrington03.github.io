Hello! I'm Daniel, an undergraduate physics and math student at Tufts University and researcher in the lab of Markus Greiner at Harvard University.

I'm broadly interested in quantum information science and ultracold atom platforms for quantum simulation and computation. I’m also interested in interfacing photonic structures with these experiments. I am currently looking to learn more about condensed matter physics, machine learning, and quantum error correction. Feel free to reach out and connect!

## Research

**Quantum simulation with ultracold atoms**

On the Lithium quantum gas experiment in the <a target="_blank" href="https://greiner.physics.harvard.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greiner lab</a> at Harvard, we are investigating low temperature Fermi–Hubbard model physics, working towards exploring exotic phases and high-temperature superconductivity.

In the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~weld/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weld lab</a> at UCSB, we are working towards simulating strong-field ultrafast dynamics and high-harmonic generation (see <a href="https://reu.physics.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/sitefiles/REUPapersTalks/2024-REU-paper-talks/Harrington-UCSB_REU_Final_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.010328" rel="noopener noreferrer">theory paper</a>) using a Strontium BEC. I worked on creating and optimizing structured optical potentials with a DMD to access strong field simulation regimes.

**Nanophotonics**

In the <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/amohanty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohanty lab</a> at Tufts, we work on devices and techniques for visible wavelength spatial mode modulation in Si\\(\_\mathsf{3}\\)N\\(\_\mathsf{4}\\)  photonic integrated chips. I worked on a method for structured light generation with a multimode waveguide, available <a href="https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-33-8-18197&id=570316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

**2D Materials**

In the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/nanoscale-device-characterization-division/nanoscale-spectroscopy-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanoscale Spectroscopy Group</a> at NIST, we work on spectroscopic techniques to study optical and electronic properties of materials and devices. I worked on studying carrier dynamics in MoS\\(_\mathsf{2}\\) and improving figures of merit for photodetectors using polymer passivation layers, work available <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/124/1/012106/2932300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
